# Git for dummies

## Working with branches

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

<pre>$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]</pre>


Push the branch on github :

<pre>$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]</pre>

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set-upstream.

You can see all the branches created by using :

<pre>$ git branch -a</pre>
