# I've been doing it wrong


This article presents some python features that everyone should try using. I'll try to be as educational as possible but this is intended for people that already have basic knowledge in computer science. In most cases I'll present a problem with a first implementation and progressively add python flavor to it. In some cases examples will come from code I saw on [stackoverflow][1] or [Exercism.io][2], sometimes the example will be a code of mine and in some other cases the examples will be purely fictional. If by any chance you see a code you wrote here and you want it to be removed then you can ask contact me.

Note that everything is more or less in arbitrary order (even though I'll try to maintain a complexity order), you can use the following indexes if you are looking for a specific subject.

Everytime you see the python logo somewhere, this means there is a link to the documentation:

**str.lower()** ![images/py.png](images/py.png)
