    "In python classes are themselves instances of another class. That look to make no sense, because it doesn't really, you can't make sense of that if you stay inside python. If all classes are instances of another class, then how was the first class instanciated? And what is its type? It's a bit like Chicken-and-egg. But there is a solution to this particular dilema. In python, the base type of a metaclass is called `type`. This class (yes!) is built outside the logic of the python language which allow such a twisted outcome where `type` is of its own type (since its also a class). Basically you just need to have faith in the fact that `type` is well defined and that all classes are of type `type`.
